 Working on projects is a great way to improve your data structures and algorithms skills in Python. Here are a few project ideas that i can tackle to strengthen my understanding:

1. Algorithm Visualizer:
   - Create a tool that visually represents different sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort) in action. Use a graphical library like Pygame or Tkinter to illustrate how the algorithms work step by step.

2. Pathfinding Visualizer:
   - Build a program that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, A*). Allow users to create obstacles and observe how the algorithms find the shortest path.

3. Text-Based Adventure Game:
   - Implement a text-based game that incorporates various data structures. Use graphs for representing locations, trees for decision-making, and hash tables for managing game state.

4. Web Scraper: 
   - Develop a web scraper using Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. Extract information from websites and organize the data using appropriate data structures.

5. Database Indexing:
   - Create a simple database indexing system. Implement basic operations like inserting, deleting, and searching records. Use tree-based data structures like B-trees or hash tables for indexing.

6. Job Scheduler:
   - Build a simple job scheduler that manages tasks with different priorities and deadlines. Use heaps or priority queues to efficiently schedule and execute jobs.

7. Stock Price Analyzer:
   - Create a program that analyzes historical stock price data. Implement algorithms to find trends, calculate moving averages, or identify potential buying/selling points.

8. Spell Checker:
   - Develop a spell-checking application using a trie data structure to efficiently store and search for words. Consider incorporating Levenshtein distance for suggesting corrections.

9. Network Analysis Tool:
   - Build a tool that analyzes a network graph. Implement algorithms to find connected components, calculate centrality measures, or identify important nodes.

10. Machine Learning Classifier:
    - Implement a basic machine learning classifier (e.g., decision tree, k-nearest neighbors) from scratch. Train and evaluate the classifier on a dataset.

Note to self:
Remember to focus not only on solving problems but also on optimizing your solutions. Analyze time and space complexity, and explore different approaches to the same problem. Additionally, platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal offer a variety of algorithmic challenges that you can solve to enhance your skills.
